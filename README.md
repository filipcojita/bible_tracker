# bible_tracker
This website was created in order help our youth ministrys discount program for the 2025 camp.
Youths have to read their Bible every day and write something about what they read that day.
There is a 3-day window to complete a day.
Each completed day has a 2 RON discount for the general price of the camp.
There is a login page, a submit page, a home page, a leaderboard page (top 10 and user placement), and a (private) admin page
All user data and submission data is synced with a myphpadmin sql database.
Website is hosted on Hostinger at tineretsperanta.net until the end of 2025.
Project done by me, with the help of AI.
